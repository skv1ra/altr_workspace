# Project status

Updated by every implementation prompt at the end of its session.

## Current active prompt

None — Prompt 002 complete; awaiting `RUN PROMPT 003`.

## Completed prompts

- 001 — Workspace and legacy baseline (2026-07-19). See
  `docs/claude-prompts/BASELINE_V2.md`. WORKSPACE (`altr_workspace`) origin
  verified, contains no app code yet (expected — nothing from the build
  sequence has run). LEGACY (`altrtest2`, pinned SHA `a22927d`, verified
  no drift) was reproduced read-only in a disposable git worktree on `D:`
  (never touching the real checkout): `yarn install`/`lint`/`typecheck`/
  `build` all passed (exit 0); `yarn test` passed all 97/97 tests across 12
  files but exited 1 due to Vitest fork-pool worker OOM crashes (real
  environment issue, not a test failure — see BASELINE_V2 §2.3). Inventory
  counts (21 pages, 30 API routes, 14 migrations, 30 test files) cross-checked
  against `FEATURE_PARITY_MATRIX.md` with no mismatch.
- 002 — Parity and security audit verification (2026-07-19). Read-only audit
  of LEGACY (`altrtest2` @ `a22927d`) against `FEATURE_PARITY_MATRIX.md` and
  `MASTER_CONTEXT.md`'s security invariants; no LEGACY writes, no WORKSPACE
  code changes. One evidence-path fix (Cookie preferences button's real path
  is `components/legal/CookiePreferencesButton.tsx`); no COMPLETE row needed
  reclassifying. All 10 security invariants verified with file:line citations
  (added to `FEATURE_PARITY_MATRIX.md` § "Verified invariants") — all hold,
  except one citation gap (invariant #3 cites a test file that doesn't
  actually check what MASTER_CONTEXT claims; tracked as RISKS.md R12, not
  fixed here since MASTER_CONTEXT.md is outside this prompt's allowed files).
  Both canonical-module questions resolved: `lib/auth/rateLimit.ts` is fully
  dead (safe to delete in Prompt 004); `lib/plans.ts` and
  `lib/billing/plans.ts` are **both** live for different concerns, which is a
  price-desync risk tracked as RISKS.md R11. Traceability gate holds (no
  COMPLETE row missing a rebuild/test/manual-check prompt). All 26 `altr_`
  tables confirmed RLS-covered.

## Failed prompts

None.

## Blocked prompts

None (001's findings are recorded as blockers for future prompts, not a
blocked status for 001 itself — every 001 acceptance criterion was met).

## Last successful build

LEGACY (`altrtest2` @ `a22927d`, disposable worktree): `yarn build` passed,
2026-07-19 (see `BASELINE_V2.md` §2.3). WORKSPACE: not yet run — no
`package.json`/build tooling exists in `altr_workspace` yet.

## Last successful test run

LEGACY (`altrtest2` @ `a22927d`, disposable worktree): `yarn test`, 2026-07-19
— 97/97 tests passed across 12 files; command exit code was 1 due to Vitest
worker OOM crashes, not test failures (see `BASELINE_V2.md` §2.3 for why this
isn't a clean pass to cite blindly). WORKSPACE: not yet run — no test suite
exists in `altr_workspace` yet.

## Known regressions

None recorded.

## Unresolved decisions

- ADR-007 (hybrid hero) must be confirmed or amended by the Prompt 012 prototype.
- Final choice of self-hosted variable font (Inter vs Geist) — decided in Prompt 007.
- Whether a separate staging Supabase project will be provisioned (ADR-012) —
  user decision needed before Prompt 051.

## Environment notes

- **Repository model (resolved 2026-07-19):** the new application is built from
  scratch in this repository — `skv1ra/altr_workspace`, local root
  `C:\Users\golyb\OneDrive\Робочий стіл\altr_web`, branch `main`, origin
  verified as `https://github.com/skv1ra/altr_workspace.git`. The legacy
  implementation `skv1ra/altrtest2` (local read-only checkout at
  `C:\Users\golyb\altrtest2`, pinned audit SHA `a22927d`) is inspection-only:
  no edits, commits, or pushes ever target it. Proven backend behavior is
  ported per ADR-001/ADR-002 (bulk port in Prompt 004). See MASTER_CONTEXT
  § Repository model for the binding rules.
- **`C:` drive has almost no free space** (119G/119G used, ~197 MB free as of
  2026-07-19 — pre-existing, unrelated to any prompt). Prompt 001 hit this
  running the LEGACY reproduction and worked around it by using the `D:`
  drive (124G free) for the disposable worktree, yarn cache, and
  `node_modules`. Any future WORKSPACE install/build should redirect there
  too unless `C:` is freed up first.
- Hero reference: DONE — full-resolution image verified at
  `references/altr-hero-reference.png` (2026-07-19); DESIGN_DIRECTION updated
  from the full image. Original upload folder `altr-hero-reference.png/`
  retained at repo root; it can be deleted once the canonical copy is committed.

## Environment setup still required (user-owned)
- Production values for all variables in `.env.example` (Supabase, Lemon Squeezy
  incl. variant IDs and webhook secret, OpenAI; optional Resend/Sentry).
- Supabase dashboard: Google OAuth provider credentials (only if Google sign-in
  stays enabled), auth redirect URLs, email templates.
- Lemon Squeezy dashboard: webhook pointed at `<prod-url>/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy`.
- Vercel project linked with env vars for Preview and Production.
- Legal owner details in `lib/legal/legal-config.ts` (see docs/LEGAL_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md).

## Screen inventory (legacy vs rebuilt)

All screens currently legacy. Prompts flip entries to "rebuilt" as they land.
